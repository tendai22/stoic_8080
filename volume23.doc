BECAUSE OF SPACE LIMITS, THE FILE STOIC.COM WAS NOT PLACED ON
THIS DISKETTE, AS SUGGESTED IN STOICCPM.DOC.  ALSO THE BOOTSTRAP
AND DOCUMENTATION ON THE BOOT AND SYSTEM LOADING WERE OMITTED.  THEY
CAN BE OBTAINED A VOLUME 23B, BUT IN ANY EVENT WILL APPEAR AS PART
OF A REGULARLY SCHEDULED FUTURE RELEASE.

TO CONSTRUCT THE STOIC.COM, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSEMBLE THE KERNEL
AND THEN HAVE IT LOAD THE BASIC DEFINITIONS.  AS EXPLAINED BELOW, THE

NOTE THAT THE VALUE OF THE WORD "UNIT" IS DEFAULTED TO 0 IN
THE KERNEL.  THIS DEFINES THE DISK DRIVE FOR LOADING.  THE WORD

IS DEFINED IN STOICBAS.  TO CHANGE THE VALUE TYPE

		0 UNIT !

WHICH WILL ALLOW THE FUNCTION
