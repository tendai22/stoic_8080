;
;THIS DISK CONTAINS THE STOIC SOURCE AND COM FILES. MOST OF THE
;FILES WILL HAVE CORRESPONDING DOC FILES ON ANOTHER DISK. IT IS
;A MUST THAT THEY BE READ PRIOR TO WORKING WITH
;THIS DISK.
;
;THE SUPPLIED STOIC.COM FILE CONTAINS THE KERNEL AND THE STOICBAS.STC FILE.
;THIS COMPRISES THE MINIUM STOIC MACHINE, AND NEEDS ABOUT 13000 BYTES
;IN THE TPA TO RUN. I HAVE IMPLEMENTED A "CPMLD" COMMAND WHICH CAN BE
;USED TO LOAD OTHER STC FILES IF DESIRED.
; TO USE BRING UP STOIC WHICH WILL PROMPT WITH

;TO LOAD A STC FILE TYPE

0> 'STOICXXX CPMLD

;WHERE XXX IS ONE OF THE STOIC.STC FILES
; UPON COMPLEMENTION STOIC WILL AGIAN PROMPT WITH

;YOU SHOULD NOW SAVE THIS NEW STOIC USING THE CPM "SAVE" COMMAND
; PRIOR TO THIS COMPUTE THE PRESENT SIZE OF STOIC 

0> SZSTOIC

;THE SZSTOIC COMMAND WILL RESPOND

STOIC IS YY  PAGES LONG

;NOW RETURN TO CPM

;HERE STOIC WILL REBOOT CPM AND RETURN CONTROL

;NOW "SAVE" THIS NEW STOIC

A>SAVE YY STOIC.COM

;IF YOU'VE GOTTEN THIS FAR STOIC SHOULD BE WORKING
